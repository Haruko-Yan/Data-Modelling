Title:Screening cervical cancer
Authors: s3560484 Ailin Dou & s3749857 Ziqing Yan
Searched the data set: Cervical cancer behavior risk data set (sobar-72.csv)
Resources:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cervical+Cancer+Behavior+Risk
Description: The purpose of the project is to retrive and analyse the data set, and then establishing the suitable data modelling to accurately screen cervical cancer. 
Language: Python
Used applications: Anaconda-Jupyter & Google docs
Library: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn
Instructions:
	1. Import the require libraries
	2. Import and read the Cervical cancer behavior risk data set (sobar-72.csv)
	3. Retrive the contents of the data set
	4. Save the completed data set
	5. Develop the related data visualistaion for each variable in the data set
	6. Explore the relationships between the ca_cervix and other elements
	7. Train the k-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree models
	8. Compare the performance of the two models
